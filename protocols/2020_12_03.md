This is a protocol and an agenda at the same time. One person will take notes on the meeting with our TA.

# Agenda
- We will first try it with the abstract only to see how well it works. 
- We have partially the whole body the paper, so we can try to see the difference in performance (hopefully)
- arxive: What degree of automation is possible to extract certain topics?
- Where should we store our datasets?
    + How much GB do we need and where are we provided
- Should we sample our dataset and evaluate with a human baseline?
- Our plan:
    + Divide workload into 2 teams: Dataset/-processing, algorithms
    + Algorihtms team sets up clustering skeleton and works on manually downloaded data
    + Data team sets up scraper and preprocessing skeletons
