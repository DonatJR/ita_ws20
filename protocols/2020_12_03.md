Protocols
===
This is a protocol and an agenda at the same time. One person will take notes on the meeting with our TA.

# Agenda
- We will first try it with the abstract only to see how well it works. 
- We have partially the whole body the paper, so we can try to see the difference in performance (hopefully)
- arxive: What degree of automation is possible to extract certain topics?
- Where should we store our datasets?
    + How much GB do we need and where are we provided
- Should we sample our dataset and evaluate with a human baseline?
- Our plan:
    + Divide workload into 2 teams: Dataset/-processing, algorithms
    + Algorihtms team sets up clustering skeleton and works on manually downloaded data
    + Data team sets up scraper and preprocessing skeletons

# Meeting notes

- it's important to have equal contributions from every team member, especially if team members have different backgrounds and previous knowledge

- project milestone 
  - there was an email regarding this saying pretty much the same with as was discussed in the meeting: progress report based on your first insights from working with your data/baseline, or APIs/Frameworks you want to use in the project, and what impact this has on your further actions

- arXiv: TA says there is an API for downloading single files and also the possibility to download data dumps

- using a database: not really necessary but is of course nice to work with if we already have the required know-how

- human baseline for evaluation: its difficult to find a good quantitative evaluation for clustering, so having a human baseline is a good idea

- we can look for `ccs tags` in papers for grouping / checking if similar tags are used in similar papers 
  - https://dl.acm.org/ccs
  - https://dbs.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/files/Team/phausner/publications/Hausner_Aumiller_Gertz_CIKM2020.pdf
    
- TA expects us to have around 50 clusters in the end, but this is of course no hard requirement

- we should document everything the whole time and correct older notes / assumptions as we go

- if we have questions we should write mails with clearly defined and understandable questions and also give a deadline until we need an answer (can be short notice)
