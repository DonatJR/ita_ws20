\subsection{Main project goals}

practicalities of your approach, this time with a clearer focus on the application:
- make it easier for users to search and explore scientific papers belonging to a specific topic / theme
- create cluster representation that makes this easy to include in downstream tasks

Our main goal is to make it easier for users to search and explore scientific papers belonging to a specific topic or theme.
For this we want to specifically arrive at a clustering (representation) that, for one, separates the different documents into correct clusters, but is also easy to work with in downstream tasks (e.g. the mentioned inclusion in some search site).
To achieve this we basically interpret the steps mentioned in the subsection \ref{subsec:pipeline} as some coarse sub goals, which can then be worked on by different team members.
Some of these sub goals can also be further divided, for example downloading and preprocessing data from different sources or implementing distinct clustering algorithms can be done by a single team member respectively.
