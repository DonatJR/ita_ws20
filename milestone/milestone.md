### Existing Code Fragments
In case you are choosing a project for which there exists code that you are using, you must clearly indicate those parts of your project and link to them.
TODO: we are not using any existing code, right? --> replace with "No existing code fragments used." 

### Utilized libraries
TODO: Provide a list of all required libraries to successfully run your system. Ideally, this comes in the __form of a separate requirements.txt file__.

### Contributions
We had some issues with non-matching email addresses in commits. This results in some team members not showing up as project contributors (or with reduced contributions), as their GitHub profile cannot be linked to the git user used to make the commits. The commit history nevertheless reflects all contributions correctly, just without a direct link to the respective GitHub profile.

## Project State

### Planning State
TODO: brief overview of everything we have done until now

### Future Planing
TODO: brief timeline of tasks to be done in second phase of project

### High-level Architecture Description
TODO: high level description of _project structure_ and _pipeline_.

### Experiments
TODO: In case that you already have some results from initial experiments, you may detail the results and implications. We strongly encourage you to already provide simple baselines.

## Data Analysis

### Data Sources
TODO: list all data sources we are using (should be the same as in proposal if we don't run into any problems over the next few days)

### Preprocessing
TODO: Detail any preprocessing steps you have taken to ensure proper data quality. This can include unicode normalization, length normalization, text sanitizing, etc

### Basic Statistics
TODO: List basic information, such as, number of samples, mean, median & standard deviation. You may utilize plots similar to ones presented during the tutorials to support your description.

### Examples
TODO: Give at least one example of a data sample from your collection. You can additionally provide edge cases where additional assumptions about the data are necessary
