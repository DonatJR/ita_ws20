\subsection{Dimensionality Reduction}
It is possible to perform a dimensionality reduction before doing the clustering.
This often reduces the computation time, and by using only the most important features of the data, the results can sometimes be improved.  

\subsubsection{Latent Semantic Analysis }
\subsubcomment{Written by Jessica Kaechele}
In addition to Topic Modeling, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) can also be used for the dimensionality reduction of texts.
The documents are first represented as a term-document matrix, where the rows represent a word and the columns represent a document.
The cells contain the frequency in which the terms occur in a document.
The tf-idf matrix is then calculated from this matrix, by multiplying frequencies with the inverse document frequency.
Afterward, a singular vector decomposition is performed.\cite{lsa}
