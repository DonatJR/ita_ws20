\section{Note}
In the github repository state of 25.02.21 (commit: \textit{6e71af9}), there is an intermediate file \textit{data\_2021-02-01\_22-27-13.862993\_labeled.json} which has the wrong format as it was generated by an old version of our pipeline. Generating the data with the up-to-date pipeline will generate a file with the correct format. The clustering will not work with this file. It has been updated in the meantime (\url{https://github.com/DonatJR/ita_ws20/blob/main/src/data/data_2021-02-01_22-27-13.862993_labeled.json}). Please use the updated file or generate a new one.
