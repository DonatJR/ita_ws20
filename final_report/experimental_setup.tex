\subsection{Experimental Setup}
\subcomment{Written by Jonas Reinwald}
Before implementing our final pipeline we used Jupyter notebooks to experiment with various clustering algorithms, to get a feel for their behavior and find a set of good performing parameters.

The insights and written code from these experiments were then used to create the clustering pipeline. It performs these steps in succession of each other:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Loading the data
    \item Setting up the pre-processor and applying it to the data
    \item Perform clustering on the pre-processed data
    \item Extracting and saving results from the generated clusters
    \item (Optional) Evaluating the results by comparing it with ground-truth data
\end{enumerate}

The code must be provided with a configuration file which includes options to alter the pipeline execution. These options include but are not limited to the data input and output path, the library and type of pre-processing which is to be done on the input data, the kind of (optional) dimensionality reduction and the clustering method, with some changeable parameters, to use.
We provide one default configuration file for all included clustering approaches with which the results in the following sections can be reproduced.
