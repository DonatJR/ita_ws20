\section*{Abstract}
Research nowadays is at an all-time high, with research papers getting published every day.
Over the last decade alone, the number of research papers on machine learning has more than tripled \cite{dimensions}.
However, this comes with a downside, as it is getting harder and harder to keep track of trends and find specific information.
To address this issue, we propose a clustering solution that exploits the standardized submission pipeline.
Each submission consists of a title, an abstract, a text body, and a set of keywords that best describe the paper.
We use the keywords from a set of over two thousand research papers on machine learning as supervision for clustering the abstracts in the hopes of finding and exploring subtopics.
